1. Restrict predicted output to 3 decimel places
2. Design a better home page + Clean UI
3. Import every other ML model
4. Create pickle file for Guassian Model and then use that model for prediction.
    - Very Slow (Process Time : 4-5 minutes)
5. Refactor Neural Network function -> parameters can be removed
